# About the project

This is an AngularJs wrapper for the Ziggeo video service. It can make your life less miserable. I made this during the HackTheNorth 2014.

## Getting Started

You need to first include the Ziggeo Javascript and Css files. You will also need to include your
api key.

``` html

<link rel="stylesheet" href="//assets.ziggeo.com/css/ziggeo-betajs-player.min.css" />
<script src="//assets.ziggeo.com/js/ziggeo-jquery-json2-betajs-player.min.js"></script>
<script>ZiggeoApi.token = "YOUR_API_KEY";</script>

```

*Note:* Ziggeo might update their API in the future so it is better to use the latest js and css files
posted in their [official docs](https://ssl.ziggeo.com/docs).

```
bower install angular-ziggeo
```

Then include the angular-ziggeo.min.js or angular-ziggeo.js for debugging purposes.

## Using the ziggeo-angular directive

It is really simple to use the the ziggeo-angular directive. ziggeo-angular can do everything that
 the JavaScript API does.

 ``` html
 <ziggeo-angular options="options"></ziggeo-angular>
 ```
 Here is a complete outline of all supported parameters:

 - width (int): Width of the embedding
 - height (int): Height of the embedding
 - responsive (bool): Embedding maximizes to the size of the bounding box
 - popup_width (int): Width of the popup
 - popup_height (int): Height of the popup
 - popup (bool): Popup the player after clicking on play
 - video (string): Video token or key
 - stream (string): Stream token or key
 - modes (array): Allowed modes for embedding (specify them as comma-separated list in the embedding or as an array when calling JavaScript commands):
 1. recorder: Allows the embedding to be used as recorder
 2. player: Allows the embedding to be used as player
 3. rerecorder: Allows the embedding to be used as rerecorder
 - tags (array): Tags that a newly created video should be associated with
 - perms (array): Video permissions	â€” Allow options are (specify them as comma-separated list in the embedding or as an array when calling JavaScript commands):
 - allowupload: Enable uploading of custom user videos
 - forbidrecord: Disable recording using the user's webcam
 - forbidswitch: Disable switching between uploading and recording
 - forbidrerecord: Disable rerecording
 - disable_first_screen (bool): Disable the initial screen of the recorder
 - disable_device_test (bool): Disable testing microphone and camera before recording the user
 - disable_timer (bool): Disable showing the recording time to the user
 - key (string): Key that a newly created video should be associated with
 - limit (int): Maximum duration of video
 - countdown (int): Countdown before recording starts (default is 5 seconds, minimum is 3 seconds)
 - input_bind (string): Bind video token to form input field by given name
 - form_accept (string): Only allow form submission (jquery selector) if video has been recorded
 - id (string): Id of embedding to look it up
 - client_auth (string): Client-Side Authorization Token
 - rerecordings (int): Limit the number of rerecordings

  You just have to set the options object according to your desired settings.

  }
  ```
